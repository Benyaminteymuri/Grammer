Common Mistakes and Misunderstandings

===================================================

- I am agree / i am disagree => i agree / i disagree

- Many of students applied to electrical engineering => Many students applied to electrical engineering / Many of the students applied to electrical engineering 

"Many of" will always be followed by a word such as those, these, them, us, her, his, my, your, our, or the, and a noun, if needed. 

"Many of the kids from our school went to the park." 

"Many" will only be followed by a noun or noun phrase without an article or pronoun. 

"Many kids from our school went to the park." 

The man states that there aren't much students in the library => the man states that there aren't many students in the library 

Many & Much: “many” can be used only with countable nouns in the plural (e.g. “many trees”, “many houses”, “many people”), and “much” can only be used with uncountable nouns in the singular (e.g. “much water”, “much wood”, “much happiness”) 

A lot of people doesn’t know the real meaning of the word “privacy” => A lot of people don't know the real meaning of the word “privacy 

We use a lot of or lots of with both countable and uncountable nouns. 

If the noun is countable, we use a plural verb 

"Lots of new houses were built last year." 

"There are a lot of cars in the world" NOT "There is a lot of cars in the world" (even though "a lot of" is singular itself) 

If the noun is uncountable, we use a singular verb 

"There is a lot of noise." 

"There is lots of food in the cupboard" NOT "There are lots of food in the cupboard " ◇ Lightening is the present participle of the verb lighten. -سبک کردن/ روشن کردن- 

Lightning is the electrical discharge that happens during storms. -رعد و برق- 

Lighting is the equipment in a room, building, or street for producing light. -نور پردازی/ روشنایی- 

It’s much more easier => it's much easier 

It’s much more colder today => it's much colder today 

It's much expensive than the others => it's much more expensive than the others 

Remember: all adjectives in English are divided into two groups. Depending on what group the word belongs, you EITHER add -er to the adjective OR more before it. We do not use more or most together with an -er or -est ending. 

"The university has decided to transform the campus dining hall to the campus dining club for one week at the end of each semester" NOT "The university has decided to transfer the campus dining hall to the campus dining club for one week at the end of each semester" 

Transmit, Transfer and transport all mean "to move something from one place to another", but each has a different general usage, depending on what is being moved. "transmit" is most often used with information. 

"transfer" generally refers to something changing possession, especially in law. 

"transport" refers to shipping a physical item or person. 

However, transform means: make a marked change in the form, nature, or appearance of something 

At first, in traditional classes students can interact with each other => first of all / first, in traditional classes students can interact with each other. ◇ "at first" means "in or at the beginning" It CANNOT be used instead of "first of all" 

"Second of all" is also wrong, use "secondly" instead. 

The students discussed about the recent change in the university => the students discussed the recent change in the university. 

You can discuss something, or you can talk about it, but "discuss about" is redundant. 

If you want to use the word about, you can "have a conversation about", "confer about" or "debate about" somethig. 

The university decided to make changes to the school's sculpture program => the university has decided to make changes to the school's sculpture program 

When you want to talk about something that has happened in the past and has a connection to the present, it's better to use present perfect. 

Because the student's lack of interest... => because of the student's lack of interest 

Because that online courses.... , students can... => since online courses..., students can... 

This is because make privacy for students => this is because they want to make privacy for students / in order to make privacy for students 

Pay attention to the correct use of because. 

i agree with that students shouldn't take cellphones to class => i agree that students shouldn't take cellphones to class/ i agree with the statement that students shouldn't take cellphones to class 

I disagree with this statement which it says families have the most influence on kids => i disagree with the statement that families have the most influence on kids 

Pay attention to the correct way of announcing your agreement/ disagreement 

Some commonly used uncountable nouns: 

Homework/ assignment/ information / knowledge/ management/ motivation/ nutrition / pollution / poverty / research / progress / quality / room (space) / silence / smoke / stress / time / traffic/ transportation / travel / usage / violence / wealth 

Pay attention to the correct usage of these words. We usually treat uncountable nouns as singular. We use a singular verb for them. We do not usually use the indefinite article a/an with uncountable nouns. We can use some, any, a little and much with uncountable nouns. 

the student compliments the university's cafeteria => the student complains about the university's cafeteria 

Complaint : a grievance, problem, difficulty, or concern; the act of complaining 

Compliment: an expression of praise, congratulation, encouragement, or respect 

The professor expanded the due date for the assignment => The professor extended the due date for the assignment 

Extend means “to stretch out", cause to last longer, or to make larger. 

"The student asked the university to extend the due date for dormitory application. " 

Expand means spread out, to increase in size, number, or importance 

"The university claims that these courses offer to expand students' knowledge in many fields." 

However means "but" 

INCORRECT: However the weather was cold, we decided not to wear our jackets. 

CORRECT: We decided not to wear our jackets. However, it was rather cold. 

Although means "in spite of the fact that..." 

INCORRECT: We decided not to wear our jackets. Although, it was rather cold. 

CORRECT: Although the weather was cold, we decided not to wear our jackets. 

So =>

We use "however" at the beginning of a new sentence, with a comma after it. 

"Although" can be used at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence, but it doesn't have a comma afterwards. 

It's far better that the university changes the library tables => it's far better if the university changes the library tables 

'That' is a relative pronoun that introduces a noun, adjective, or an adverb clause. When it's an adverb clause, it means a purpose or result, while 'if' is used for condition, i.e. "If I read now, I will be done with homework sooner. Here, we need a conditional
