simple past negative and questions

we use (did) in simple past negative and questions

affirmative		negative					question

I played 		=> I did not (didn't) play 		=> Did I play?
they had		=> they didn't have			=> Did they have?


do/does (present) 			=> Did (past)
I don't watch TV very often		=> I dedn't watch TV yesterday.
Does she go out often?			=> Did she go out last night?

We use did/didn't + base form (watch/play/go, etc.): 

	I watched => I didn't watch (not I didn't watched) 
	they went => did they go? (not did they went?)
	he had => he didn't have
	you did => did you do? 

Study the word order in questions: 
		did + subject + base form 

Did your sister call you?
What did you do last night? 
How did the accident happen? 
Where did your parents go on vacation?
