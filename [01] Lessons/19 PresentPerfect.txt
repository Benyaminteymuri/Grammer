present perfect and past

Kate is making coffee.
KAte has made some coffee.

Kate has made some coffee = she made some coffee and the coffee is ready now.

You can use the present perfect (have done / has made, etc.) for new information: 
    "I've decided to quit my job."          "Really? Why?" 
    We've sold our car. Now we take the bus every day.
    They're having a party next week, but they haven't invited me. 
    I'm looking for Amy. Have you seen her?

You can also use the past (I decided, we sold, etc.) in these examples: 
    I decided to quit my job. 
    
We say that something has changed. It is different now from what it was before: 
    Her English has improved. It's pretty good now. 
    The city has changed a lot. It's very different now. 

We use the past, not the present perfect, with the finished time (last year/yesterday):
    They arrived yesterday. not have arrived.
    Where were U on Sunday? not Where have U been?

We use the past to ask When ....? OR What time ...?
    When did U sell U're car? not When have U sold ...?
    What time did Ben go out? not What time has ...?

We use the present perfect with yet in negative sentences and questions. 
Yet (= until now) is usually at the end: 

    A: Does James know that you're going away? 
    B: No, I haven't told him yet. 

    A: Have Sarah and Nick arrived yet? 
    B: No, not yet, but they'll be here soon. 

    A: Has Nicole started her new job yet? 
    B: No, she's starting next week. 

    Silvia has bought a new dress, but she hasn't worn it yet. 


You can also use the past with yet: 
    
    Did Nicole start her new job yet?
