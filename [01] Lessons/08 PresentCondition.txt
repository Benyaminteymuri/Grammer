present condition and simple present

present condition (I am doing) = now, at the time of speaking
simple present (I do) = in general, all the time, or sometimes

Jack is watching television. 
He is not playing the guitar. 

But Jack has a guitar. 
He plays it a lot, and he plays very well. 

Jack plays the guitar, 
but he is not playing the guitar now. 


Is he playing the guitar? No, he isn't. (present continuous)
Does he play the guitar? Yes, he does.  (simple present) 

We do not use these verbs in the present continuous (I am -ing): 

    like        want        know        understand      remember 
    prefer      need        mean        believe         forget 

Use only the simple present with these verbs (I want / do you like?, etc.):

I'm tired. I want to go home. (not I'm wanting)
"Do you know that girl?" "Yes, but I don't remember her name."
I don't understand. What do you mean?
